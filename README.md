# SMART Soccer Coaching Servcies

This is a website to promote my (Gustaf Ljungwaldh) coaching services, based in Stockholm, Sweden. My coaching services would aim towards players, parents and football teams, as well as provide content that can help aspiring players/coaches. I am currently a coach at one of Stockholm's elite football clubs Djurgårdens IF, and wish I wish to also offer my expertise on a consultant/personal trainer basis.

The website will help to inform customers about:
* Myself (Gustaf Ljungwaldh) and my coaching profile
* My philsophy towards coaching and player development
* Services I provide
* A blog where I share free content
* How they can request for my services

The services available will range from coaching individuals, groups, and football teams. The service will be hourly rates for individuals and groups, aiming to run tailor-made training sessions. Coaching services for football teams will be custom-made offerings based on the needs of the team, where filling out the service request form will provide a starting point of discussing scope and pricing for the team's custom-made service.

Business goals of website include:
* Build awareness of my coaching services
* Drive my own business on the side of my current work with Djurgårdens IF
* Promote a positive brand of myself as a coach

Goals of customer for my website include:
* Find high quality content they can utilize immediately for becoming better football players/coaches
* Clear understanding of services available and pricing model
* Convenient way of requesting my coaching services

## UX

### Ideal customer
#### The customers visiting my website would be:
* English and/or Swedish speaking
* Have disposbale income
* A parent of a player, a player in a team, or a coach of a team

#### Visitors of my wbesite are looking for:
* Inspiration for improving themselves as players and/or coaches that can be used right away
* Professional support for a player's/group's/team's development

#### This project and website can provide a great solution for them for the following reasons:
* Sparse amount of football coaches offering this kind of service in the Stockholm area
* No coaches in the Stockholm area providing information and language of service in English, therefore making it difficult for the international community
* Websites with similar services offered in the Stockholm area are either poorly designed or provide too much information, therefore not providing a great user experience
* My website will emphasize great user design and experience, aiming for simplicity so more focus can be placed on action/taking the next step for customers. The website will be easy to navigate, provide clear and concise information, and all this leading to customers easily coming towards the service request form.

# Features

## Consistent Features

Ever-present features within the website include a fixed navigation bar, allowing easy access to other parts of the website without having to scoll to
the top of the page. The navigation bar contains a logo on the left-hand side and the menu items on the right-hand side. In mobile view,
the menu items compress under a nurger icon button, which when clicked on produces a dropdown list with the menu items listed.

The monochrome background image is ever-present throughout the website, setting the tone for the colour scheme throughout the website, alongside the navigation bar and the footer.

The footer, like the navigation bar, appears on every page, containing the logo and short text about the creator of the website, while the social media icon links appear
on the right side of the footer. This can help guiode the user to more content related to the website on other social media platforms. 

A design principle that comnsistent throughout the website (except for the blog pages with a blog post inside) is that information is presented in groups of three, each taking
a third of the width of the page. These sections in thirds are also presented with a level of opacity - this giving exposure to the main background image while still
allowing the user to read the content presented. The design is aimed to give a positive user experience, where the subtle presence of the background image at all times
gives the sense of power towards training.

## Home

Users land on the home page, first seeing the hero header and slogan. This page takes a predominatly monochrome theme towards black and white, this colour scheme continuing
on to the About Me, SMART Philosophy, and How I can Help You sections. These three pieces of information cover the introduction of the website and overview of what's on offer.
This helps users to identify quickly what to expect from the website - that Gustaf Ljungwaldh provides soccer coaching services. Each section of the introduction also 
includes black and white photos to give further context to the section header and text. On smaller, mobile devices, these introduction sections stack on top of each
other vertically as apposed to aligning horizontally in larger screens.

Below the initial introduction section features a carousel for the testimonial section. The section has a clear heading, and presents three testimonials at a time (with 6
in total). To give the page some colour and contrast, the testimonial cards are given a dark blue bnackground colour as well as full colour photos to give visual profile
of the testimonials. On smaller, mobile devices, the carousel changes to one where one testimonial is presented at a time instead of three. This is to ensure that users don't
become overwhelmed by three carousel items scrolling across when stacked vertically on top of each other. The carousel scrolls automatically, however, users can click on
the left and the right of the carousel to move to the previous/next carousel item/set. Users can also navigate on the carousel by clcicking on one of the bars Below
the carousel row.

The sections of the introduction and the cards in the carousel all have hover stylings applied, giving users subtle feedback on which piece of content they are hovering
over and focusing on. This is done by the images enlaserging themselves slightly when the section/card is hovered over.
