# SMART Soccer Coaching Servcies

This is a website to promote my (Gustaf Ljungwaldh) coaching services, based in Stockholm, Sweden. My coaching services would aim towards players, parents and football teams, as well as provide content that can help aspiring players/coaches. I am currently a coach at one of Stockholm's elite football clubs Djurgårdens IF, and wish I wish to also offer my expertise on a consultant/personal trainer basis.

The website will help to inform customers about:
*Who I am 
*My philsophy towards coaching and player development
*Services I provide
*A blog where I share free content
*How they can request for my services

The services available will range from coaching individuals, groups, and football teams. The service will be hourly rates for individuals and groups, aiming to run tailor-made training sessions. Coaching services for football teams will be custom-made offerings based on the needs of the team, where filling out the service request form will provide a starting point of discussing scope and pricing for the team's custom-made service.

Business goals of website include:
*Build awareness of my coaching services
*Drive my own business on the side of my current work with Djurgårdens IF
*Promote a positive brand of myself as a coach

Goals of customer for my website include:
*Find high quality content they can utilize immediately for becoming better football players/coaches
*Clear understanding of services available and pricing model
*Convenient way of requesting my coaching services

##UX

###Ideal customer
####The customers visiting my website would be:
*English and/or Swedish speaking
*Have disposbale income
*A parent of a player, a player in a team, or a coach of a team

####Visitors of my wbesite are looking for:
*Inspiration for improving themselves as players and/or coaches that can be used right away
*Professional support for a player's/group's/team's development'

####This project and website can provide a great solution for them for the following reasons:
*Sparse amount of football coaches offering this kind of service in the Stockholm area
*No coaches in the Stockholm area providing information and language of service in English, therefore making it difficult for the international community
*Websites with similar services offered in the Stockholm area are either poorly designed or provide too much information, therefore not providing a great user experience
*My website will emphasize great user design and experience, aiming for simplicity so more focus can be placed on action/taking the next step for customers. The website will be easy to navigate with few pages, concise information, these leading to customers easily coming towards the service request form.
